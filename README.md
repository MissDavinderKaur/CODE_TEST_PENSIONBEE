# CODE_TEST_PENSIONBEE

## Overview
The challenge here is to create a node.js application that displays HTML pages at URLs that match the names of the folders in the ```content``` folder. The content of these pages should come from a combination of the template HTML file and a markdown file containing the content.

## How it works
1) Run ```npm i```
2) Ensure ```nodemon``` is running
3) The app runs in the browser on localhost:3000

## How to run the tests
* For unit tests, run ```npm test```
